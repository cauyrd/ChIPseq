A. Definition of  Lumpy Output
==============================
1. chromosome 1
2. interval 1 start
3. interval 1 end
4. chromosome 2
5. interval 2 start
6. interval 2 end
7. id
8. evidence set score
9. strand 1
10. strand 2
11. type
12. id of samples containing evidence for this breakpoint
13. strand configurations observed in the evidence set
14. The last column is generated by my program, showing the TYPE of SVs, if it is a large deletion > 2kb, then I will label it as "TYPE:DELETION>2kb"

B. Read # supporting the SVs.
=============================
Column 12 in the output of Lumpy lists the amount of evidence from a given source.  For example "IDS:1,5" indicates that this breakpoint had 5 pieces of evidence from sample 1.

C. Output file note:
=====================
1. *.bed showed the called SVs by Lumpy
2. *.bedpe showed the called SVs with supporting reads by Lumpy
3. *.summary.txt showed the summary of each SV types.
